  Started programming back in 2015; learnt the fundamentals using Python, creating very simple
  algorithms and desktop shortcuts. Found an interest into the many aspects of web development
  from backend to frontend and everything in between.

  I had a taste of full stack development first with PHP as part of a first year University
  project, which inspired me to look into other web development frameworks/libraries i.e. Node & React.
  Since then, I've been honing my skills whilst working on my degree.

  I work with backend technologies such as Node, C# ASP.NET/.NET Core/

  I am currently studying Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence & learning Japanese on the side
  with the [AJATT](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency/) method.
